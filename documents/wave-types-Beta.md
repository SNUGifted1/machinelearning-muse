# Brainwave types

These are known as high frequency low amplitude brain waves that are commonly observed while we are awake. They are involved in conscious thought, logical thinking, and tend to have a stimulating affect. Having the right amount of beta waves allows us to focus and complete school or work-based tasks easily. Having too much beta may lead to us experiencing excessive stress and/or anxiety. The higher beta frequencies are associated with high levels of arousal. When you drink caffeine or have another stimulant, your beta activity will naturally increase. Think of these as being very fast brain waves that most people exhibit throughout the day in order to complete conscious tasks such as: critical thinking, writing, reading, and socialization.

Frequency range: 12 Hz to 40 Hz (High)
Too much: Adrenaline, anxiety, high arousal, inability to relax, stress
Too little: ADHD, daydreaming, depression, poor cognition
Optimal: Conscious focus, memory, problem solving
Increase beta waves: Coffee, energy drinks, various stimulants

BETA WAVES (12 TO 38 HZ)

Beta brainwaves are present in our normal waking state of consciousness.

Beta brainwaves dominate our normal waking state of consciousness when attention is directed towards cognitive tasks and the outside world. Beta is a ‘fast’ activity, present when we are alert, attentive, engaged in problem solving, judgment, decision making, and engaged in focused mental activity.

Beta brainwaves are further divided into three bands; Lo-Beta (Beta1, 12-15Hz) can be thought of as a 'fast idle, or musing. Beta (Beta2, 15-22Hz) is high engagement or actively figuring something out. Hi-Beta (Beta3, 22-38Hz) is highly complex thought, integrating new experiences, high anxiety, or excitement. Continual high frequency processing is not a very efficient way to run the brain, as it takes a tremendous amount of energy.

the beta wave is known in the spectrum as “high frequency low amplitude” and are normally present during a waking state. They allow for logical thought processes, and therefore are instrumental in problem-solving and decision-making activities. The proper amount is needed for finishing difficult work tasks or school work. Usually higher levels of beta waves are affiliated with more anxiety and stress. They can be elevated by stimulants and coffee.

o The frequency range of beta waves are 14 Hz to 30 Hz

o People are in this frequency when they are engaging in conscious thought and logical reasoning

o The optimal level of beta wave action allows people to focus consciously on tasks, perform problem-solving and remember things

o Too little of the beta wave presents as poor cognition, ADHD, depression and too prone to daydream

o Too much of the beat wave presents as constant adrenaline, inability to relax, over stress and anxieties

Beta (14-40Hz) — The waking consciousness and reasoning wave
Beta brain waves are associated with normal waking consciousness and a heightened state of alertness, logic and critical reasoning.
While Beta brain waves are important for effective functioning throughout the day, they also can translate into stress, anxiety and restlessness.
The voice of Beta can be described as being that nagging little inner critic that gets louder the higher you go into range. Therefore, with a majority of adults operate at Beta; it’s little surprise that stress is today’s most common health problem.
