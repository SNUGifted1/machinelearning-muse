Gamma Waves

These are involved in higher processing tasks as well as cognitive functioning. Gamma waves are important for learning, memory and information processing. It is thought that the 40 Hz gamma wave is important for the binding of our senses in regards to perception and are involved in learning new material. It has been found that individuals who are mentally challenged and have learning disabilities tend to have lower gamma activity than average.

Frequency range: 40 Hz to 100 Hz (Highest)
Too much: Anxiety, high arousal, stress
Too little: ADHD, depression, learning disabilities
Optimal: Binding senses, cognition, information processing, learning, perception, REM sleep
Increase gamma waves: Meditation

Gamma brainwaves are the fastest of brain waves (high frequency, like a flute), and relate to simultaneous processing of information from different brain areas. It passes information rapidly, and as the most subtle of the brainwave frequencies, the mind has to be quiet to access it. Gamma was dismissed as 'spare brain noise' until researchers discovered it was highly active when in states of universal love, altruism, and the ‘higher virtues’. Gamma is also above the frequency of neuronal firing, so how it is generated remains a mystery. It is speculated that Gamma rhythms modulate perception and consciousness, and that a greater presence of Gamma relates to expanded consciousness and spiritual emergence.

the gamma wave is a higher frequency and is needed for cognitive function. It plays an important part in processing information, learning and memory. Using senses to understand, memorize and process new materials is evidence of gamma wave presence. A person with lowered gamma wave activity may have difficulty with learning new things or comprehending training.

o The frequency range of gamma waves are 30 Hz to 100 Hz

o People are in this frequency when they are performing cognitive actions

o The optimal level of gamma wave action allows people to think clearly, process information, use problem-solving and logic easily

o Too little of the gamma wave presents as depression, learning disability or ADHD

o Too much of the gamma wave presents as stress, anxiety, hyper-vigilance

This range is the most recently discovered and is the fastest frequency at above 40Hz. While little is known about this state of mind, initial research shows Gamma waves are associated with bursts of insight and high-level information processing.
