# machinelearning-muse
Muse (Also Openbci) Machine learning project using tensorflow 
한글 입력이 잘 안먹혀서 어줍잖은 영어를 사용합니다 ㅠㅠ 잘못해도 봐주세여

# Purpose
Old blink, focus algorithm of muse is unstable and low-responsibility also low accuracy.
But in Electroencephalography, advancing stability, responsibility and accuracy is very important.
However thanks to google's Tensorflow library, The accessibility of Machine learning is lowered and Advanced.
So combine these together, would improve and help utilize muse's data.

# TODO
Focus and blink algorithm
